Hi, I&rsquo;m Brian.

I&rsquo;m originally from <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/GKcjZW61diw" target="_blank">Fort Lee NJ</a>, of <a href="https://armpitofamerica.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/chris-christie-2009-11-4-3-10-33.jpg?w=450" target="_blank">Chris Christie</a> Bridgegate fame, and spent several years living in in San Francisco before returning to Brooklyn NY.

I went to college at a small, private technology school in Hoboken NJ called <a href="http://www.stevens.edu/" target="_blank">Stevens Institute of Technology</a>, where I majored in Computer Science and graduated with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overachievement" target="_blank">High Honors</a>.

After a ~decade journey that involved me <a href="http://www.recode.net/2016/8/23/12600410/pinterest-instapaper-acquisition-betaworks-marco-arment" target="_blank">selling Instapaper to Pinterest</a>, becoming a Director of Engineering, and <a href="http://blog.instapaper.com/post/175953870856" target="_blank">spinning Instapaper out of Pinterest</a>, I'm back to building Instapaper full-time.
