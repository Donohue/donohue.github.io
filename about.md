Hi, I&rsquo;m Brian.

I&rsquo;m originally from <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/GKcjZW61diw" target="_blank">Fort Lee NJ</a>, of <a href="https://armpitofamerica.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/chris-christie-2009-11-4-3-10-33.jpg?w=450" target="_blank">Chris Christie</a> Bridgegate fame, and spent several years living in Brooklyn NY before moving to Oakland CA.

I went to college at a small, private technology school in Hoboken NJ called <a href="http://www.stevens.edu/" target="_blank">Stevens Institute of Technology</a>, where I majored in Computer Science and graduated with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overachievement" target="_blank">High Honors</a>.

In my post-college professional life I&rsquo;ve worked at a string of startups, including one I started that I refer to as &ldquo;a great learning experience.&rdquo;

I was previously the CEO of <a href="https://instapaper.com" target="_blank">Instapaper</a>, where I also did all of the software engineering. In August 2016 <a href="http://www.recode.net/2016/8/23/12600410/pinterest-instapaper-acquisition-betaworks-marco-arment" target="_blank">Instapaper was acquired by Pinterest</a>, where I eventually became the Director of Product Engineering.

In July 2018, <a href="http://blog.instapaper.com/post/175953870856" target="_blank">Instapaper was spun into an independent company</a> which I own and operate. In July 2021, I moved from Pinterest to DoorDash as a Director of Engineering, where I'm currently employed.
