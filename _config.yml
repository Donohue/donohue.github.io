# Welcome to Jekyll!

# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  Hi, I’m Brian. I’m originally from Fort Lee NJ, of Chris Christie Bridgegate fame, and spent several years living in Brooklyn NY before moving to Oakland CA. I went to college at a small, private technology school in Hoboken NJ called Stevens Institute of Technology, where I majored in Computer Science and graduated with High Honors. In my post-college professional life I’ve worked at a string of startups, including one I started that I refer to as “a great learning experience.” I was previously the CEO of Instapaper, where I also did all of the software engineering. In August 2016 Instapaper was acquired by Pinterest, where I continue to operate Instapaper.
